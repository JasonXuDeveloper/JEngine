- [fix] Fixes the bug where loading pdb on platforms like WebGL still does not display stack code line numbers.
- [fix] Fixes the bug where, after calling a sub-interpreter function and returning, logging prints the code line number of the called function due to `frame->ip` not being reset to `&ip`.

- [fix] Fixes the bug where calculating the `CallingConvention` of `MonoPInvokeCallback` is incorrectly treated as Winapi if the delegate is defined in another assembly, resulting in an incorrect wrapper signature calculation.
- [fix] PatchScriptingAssemblyList.cs has compilation errors on Unity 2023+ WebGL platforms.

### Runtime

- [new] ReversePInvoke supports CallingConvention.
- [fix] Fixes the bug where `calli`'s `argBasePtr=argIdx[0]` when the number of arguments is 0, due to `argIdxs` not being assigned, causing the function stack frame to point to the wrong location.

- [fix] Fixes the bug where the `no.{x}` prefix instruction is 3 bytes long but incorrectly treated as 2 bytes in the Transform.
- [fix] Fixes the bug where the `unaligned.{x}` prefix instruction is 3 bytes long but incorrectly treated as 2 bytes in the Transform.
- [opt] Removes unnecessary `INIT_CLASS` operations in `Interpreter_Execute`, as `PREPARE_NEW_FRAME_FROM_NATIVE` will always check.
- [opt] No longer caches MethodBody of non-generic functions, optimizing memory.

For example, struct A { uint8_t x; A2 y; } struct A2 { uint8_t x; int32_t y;}; and struct B { uint8_t x; uint8_t y; int32_t z; } are not equivalent under the x86_64 ABI.
- [fix] Fixes the bug where appending to an existing xcode project causes the 'Run Script' command to be duplicated the first time and subsequently fails to find --external-lib-il2-cpp, printing an error log.

## 5.3.0

Release Date: 2024-4-22.

### Runtime

- [fix] Fixes the bug where MachineState::CollectFramesWithoutDuplicates incorrectly uses `hybridclr::metadata::IsInterpreterMethod` to remove hot update functions, leading to an increasingly long StackFrames list and an infinite loop when printing the stack.

The downside is the increased overhead of maintaining the stack when calling interpreter functions.
- [fix] Fixes the serious bug where `StringUtils::Utf16ToUtf8` does not correctly handle `maxinumSize==0`, causing a significant overflow when converting strings of length 0 in `InterpreterImage::ConvertConstValue`.
- [fix] Fixes the bug where `_ReversePInvokeMethod_XXX` functions do not set `Il2CppThreadContext`, causing a crash when obtaining thread variables from native threads.
