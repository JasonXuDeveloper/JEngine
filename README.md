## Stargazers over time

[![Stargazers over time](https://starchart.cc/JasonXuDeveloper/JEngine.svg)](https://starchart.cc/JasonXuDeveloper/JEngine)

## What can JEngine do?

- **[Hot-update](Docs/en-us/WhyHotUpdate.md) solution**

  - **Resource hot update & management** is based on **[XAsset](https://github.com/xasset/xasset)** which JEngine's author has contributed into.
  - **Code hot update** is based on **[ILRuntime](https://github.com/Ourpalm/ILRuntime)** which JEngine's author has also contributed into its Unity Project.
  - **Encrypts** your hot-updatable **codes and resources**, codes will go into your assetbundles, assetbundles will be encrypt within **VFS by XAsset**, and also, your **codes will be encrypted in AES-128 ECB mode**
  - **Auto bind** hot update scripts to gameObject, no need to write codes to add stuffs

- **[Action](Docs/en-us/JAction.md) solution**

  - **Less code, does more**

  - Can be **Run in Main Thread**
  
    > As we know Task.Run in Unity will run in a new thread, which is not able to call most Unity APIs, now JAction found a solution of using Loom.
  
- **[UI](Docs/en-us/JUI.md) solution**

  - **Method-Chaining** style makes codes prettier and easier to visualize

  - **Easier to manage** lifecycle
  
    - Can **easily set up** **what** you want the UI element **to do in specific time**
  
  - **Bindable to data**
    
    - **UI can be binded to a data**, once data  has changed, it will call the method that you has binded
    
  
- **[Behaviour](Docs/en-us/JBehaviour.md)** based on MonoBehaviour

  - **More friendly to manage lifecycle**

    - You can make loop easier using JEngine

- **[Resource Management](Docs/en-us/JResource.md)** based on XAsset

  - Support generic method
  - Async/Sync methods

- **[Auto bind](Docs/en-us/AutoBind.md)** scripts from Hot-Update DLL to GameObjects & Prefabs

  - Want to make scripts from hot-update project on to GameObject? Too much to write codes to add it? Here is a solution!
  - Fill in namespace, and class of a hotupdate scripts, it will automatically bind to a GameObject
  - Can set values of public/private/static fields automatically
  - Supports numbers, bools, strings, GameObject and Components on GameObject

- **Object Pool soulution**

  - MUCH MORE Enhances the performencerather than using**Instantiate method**
    - With this solution, **you don't have to repeat instantiate gameObject**
    - Just **tell JObjectPool what gameObject you will repeatedly create**, and **how many you except to create at the start**, it will do it for you
    - Request **PoolObject** to get the GameObject
  - Easy and powerful
  - With algorithm which fairly controls gameObjects

- **[Data persistence solution](Docs/zh-cn/JSaver.md)**

  > JEngine now supports JSaver, which is a data persistance tool
  >
  > What can JSaver do?
  >
  > - Convert data into string/JSON string
  > - AES encryption
  > - Save to local storage
  > - Load data from local storage (supports generic method)
  > - Judge if has key in local
  > - Delete local Key data

- **More to explore!!!**

JEngine has its own purpose to help developers **write powerful codes which are streamlined and beautiful**; and to **help developers easier making their games**.

**If you enjoy using JEngine, please give this repo a star!**
